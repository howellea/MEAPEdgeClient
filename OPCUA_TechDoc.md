Great question, Eddy! These are all key building blocks from the `node-opcua` library, and each one plays a role in **communicating with the OPC UA server**.

Here’s a breakdown of each:

---

### 🔧 `OPCUAClient`

> The main class you use to **connect to an OPC UA server**.

- Think of it like a network socket — it handles the handshake, connection, and session creation.
- You use it like this:
  ```ts
  const client = OPCUAClient.create();
  await client.connect(endpointUrl);
  const session = await client.createSession();
  ```

---

### 🔍 `AttributeIds`

> A helper enum that tells OPC UA **what you want to read**.

- Most of the time, you're reading the `Value` of a variable node.
- The constant `AttributeIds.Value` equals `13`, which tells the server to return the node’s current value.
- Example:
  ```ts
  session.read({
    nodeId: "ns=5;s=Pump1.Temperature",
    attributeId: AttributeIds.Value
  });
  ```

---

### 🕐 `TimestampsToReturn`

> Specifies **what timestamps** you want when you read data.

- Example values:  
  - `TimestampsToReturn.Source` → When the data was generated  
  - `TimestampsToReturn.Server` → When the server sent it  
  - `TimestampsToReturn.Both` or `Neither`

⚠️ In our code, we didn’t explicitly use this yet — but it’s useful for `monitoring` or `subscription` mode.

---

### 🤝 `ClientSession`

> Represents an **active session** with the OPC UA server.

- After connecting with `client.connect()`, you need a session to actually read or write tags.
- It’s like logging in — you can’t interact with data until you’re inside a session.

You use it like this:

```ts
const session: ClientSession = await client.createSession();
```

Then use that `session` to read:

```ts
session.read({ nodeId: "...", attributeId: AttributeIds.Value });
```
